We share code on for the "Introduction to Programming" course

File structure description:
Our file structure is based on four separate HTML-files:

- Index.html - the front-page with navigation to the other pages.
- Product.html - the page where the user can add and remove from the cart
- Registration.html - where the user can register.
- Subscription.html - where the user can change his information.

Going into the js folder, the javascript is divided into nine different files:

- LineItemClass.js, ProductClass.js and UserClass.js contains the code for the classes we have implemented and the methods they have.
- Index.js includes the functions for log out and button for subscription.
- Login.js depicts the function for logging in, while RegistrationFunction.js depicts the requirements for registration of users.
- Product.js describes the code for adding and removing from cart, and also the purchase button.
- The Subscription.js  contains all we need to show the users main information, and change it, and also to show the subscription the user has made if he has purchased anything (this does not currently work properly).
- Finally, UserName.js contains a function that depicts the users name in the top left corner when itâ€™s logged in. 

Lastly, the CSS-files refers to some of the pages, and images used on the website is stored in the Images-folder.
